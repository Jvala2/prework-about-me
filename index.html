      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>My Masterâ€™s degree is in digital media and visual language, in which I specialized in techniques of visual and interactive media, as well as innovative ways to harness mobile technology in ways of reaching new audiences. In 2016 I completed a semester with Florida International University/Miami Ad Institute's digital marketing master's degree program. I then entered the master's degree program in digital media and visual language in the University of Central Florida because I believed it was a more intensive, comprehensive program.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Miami. I want to leave this city and can move anywhere within the United States.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I've been doing all sorts of things from Visual Arts and Design ranging from pencil sketches to Photoshopping to 3D modelling to costume design. I also took up writing as a minor hobby a few months ago. I am a gamer and want to make things other people like me can enjoy.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I just want to create stuff people can enjoy and experience, while having fond memories of what I've created.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Anywhere in the U.S. you want me to.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to improve my online portfolio, code well, be marketable, improve my skills, and create.</p>
